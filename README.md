# # Corbin Ball's React Portfolio
My inital bootcamp portfolio, with React!


## Description
This is the start to switching my very first HTML and CSS portfolio,
into React. This will end up looking much more polished, when completed.
Currently it has all the skeleton of information and some CSS.
It is lacking more CSS implementation to look as clean as I want.
For now it does have the required React properties in place and working.
